## ðŸ™€ A PROBLEM THAT SOLVES ðŸ™€

Imagine you have an NFT collection and you have to update a token URI due to some improvement to your
client's NFT.
ðŸ˜‰

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

## ðŸ¤– General usecase explanation ðŸ¤–

InputControl can be used to control which inputs can some addresses send to your smart contracts functions.

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

## âœ¨ How to use âœ¨

1. To use InputControl make your contract inherit InputControl and add the isAllowedInput()
   modifier in the functions you desire to control their inputs. The '\_input' parameter of the
   modifier must be = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(inputs)).

2. Additionally you can override callAllowInputsFor() if you please mixing this functionality with,
   for example, other useful ones like Owner or AccessControl contracts from OpenZeppelin.
