  "description": "InputControl can be used to control which inputs can some addresses send to your smart contracts' functions. Furthermore you can allow your user to call a function with a defined inputs sequence. Example: You want your client to call a function 3 times, first time with input value = 1, second value = 2 and third time value = 3. Input control can control that the desired values are used in the desired order.",
